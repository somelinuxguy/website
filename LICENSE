Look, I made this website to learn CSS and update my skills.
 
You are totally welcome to use this info to advance your own
kmnowledge and skills, but it would be really great if you 
did not just steal it and use it for your own without making
an effort to make it a significantly "you" kind of thing.

Nobody likes a cookie cutter.

And yes, I did make all these images in Photoshop and they
took a while because my skill is not in such things. It
would be nice if you didn't steal them either.

That's it. Thanks. Bye.
