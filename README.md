So this is just a side project I did while trying to blow off the dust from years of HTML and CSS neglect. Ya see, I learned HTML in the 90s, when CSS wasn't a thing, neither were helpful editors like Dreamweaver or Brackets.

Anywho, this is the thing I made to help me remember how to write HTML and CSS. It is ugly as fuck, but that's what happens when tech people do Design and have a license for Photoshop.
